    <h1 class="heading animated-text">About Dentistry</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="animated-text">A dentist has many responsibilities, and one of the most important is promoting good dental hygiene. This helps to prevent complications in your mouth or other parts of the body.</p>
      <p class="animated-text">A dentist also diagnoses and treats problems of the gums, teeth, and mouth. Dentists use modern technology and equipment like X-ray machines, lasers, drills, brushes, scalpels, and other medical tools when performing dental procedures. They also wear protective equipment like gloves, masks, and safety glasses to prevent the spread of germs or bacteria.</p>
      <p class="animated-text">Some common dentistry tasks include:</p>
      <ul class="animated-text">
        <li>Teaching people about dental hygiene</li>
        <li>Filling cavities</li>
        <li>Removing buildup or decay from teeth</li>
        <li>Repairing or removing damaged teeth</li>
        <li>Reviewing X-rays and diagnostics</li>
        <li>Giving anesthesia</li>
        <li>Putting in fillings or sealants</li>
        <li>Checking the growth of teeth and jawbones</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="animated-text">Dentistry requires a team approach, and the dentist is the leader. Working with the dentist are dental assistants, hygienists, and lab technicians. Together, the team ensures that people get quality dental care.</p>
      <p class="animated-text">A dentist is a healthcare provider who diagnoses and treats oral health conditions. Taking good care of your teeth and gums can help you reduce your risk for other serious health conditions, like heart disease and stroke. You should visit a dentist regularly for routine exams and cleanings.</p>
      <p class="animated-text">Taking care of your oral health is crucial not only for maintaining a beautiful smile but also for your overall well-being. Research has shown that poor oral hygiene can lead to various health problems, including cardiovascular diseases and respiratory infections. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings can help detect and prevent these issues.</p>
